        Set in a "mythic science fiction" world, the game features a <b>multiplayer "shared-world" environment with elements of role-playing games.</b> 
        Like the original, activities in Destiny 2 are divided among player versus environment <b>(PvE)</b> and player versus player <b>(PvP)</b> game types. 
        In addition to normal story missions, <b>PvE features three-player "strikes" and dungeons and six-player raids.</b> 
        A <b>free roam patrol mode</b> is also available for each destination which feature public events as well as activities not available in the original. 
        These activities have an emphasis on exploration of the destinations and interactions with non-player characters <b>(NPCs)</b>; 
        the original Destiny only featured NPCs in social spaces. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes.

        Players assume the role of a <b>Guardian</b>, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called <b>Light</b> to protect humanity from different alien races and combat the looming threat of the <b>Darkness.</b> 
        Like the original Destiny, the game features expansion packs which further the story and adds new content across the game. 
        <b>Year One of Destiny 2</b> featured two small expansions, <b>Curse of Osiris</b> and <b>Warmind.</b> 
        A third, large expansion, <b>Forsaken</b>, began Year Two with an overhaul on gameplay. 
        The release of the next expansion, <b>Shadowkeep</b> (October 2019) began Year Three. 
        Shadowkeep and future releases are considered standalone releases, not requiring players to own previous premium content. 
        Released alongside this fourth expansion was a version of Destiny 2 called <b>New Light</b>, a free-to-play re-release of Destiny 2, 
        which also included access to the first two expansions. Separate seasonal passes also became available for each season's content. 
        While the main Destiny 2 game has since been <b>free-to-play</b>, all other <b>content requires purchasing.</b>
